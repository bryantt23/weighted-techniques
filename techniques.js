Ask yourself, \"When was I upset? What time of day was it? Where was I? Who was I interacting with? What was going on?\" Now ask yourself if you're willing to roll up your sleeves and work on it now, rather than just talking about it endlessly.

The person playing the negative thoughts attacks, and the person playing the positive thoughts defends. Use role-reversals when you get stuck. In the \"I-I\" version of the Externalization of Voices, both of you will speak in the first person, \"I.\" In the \"You-I\" version, the person playing the negative thoughts will speak in the second-person, \"You,\" and the person playing the positive thoughts will speak in the first person, \"I.\" The \"I-I\" method is gentle and safe, but less effective.

Your worst fears don't usually turn out to be real monsters, but figments of your imagination that you can defeat with a little logic, compassion, and common sense. Other Role-Playing Methods include Cognitive Techniques like the Double Standard Technique and Acceptance Paradox, Motivational Techniques like the Devil's Advocate, and Exposure Techniques like the David Letterman Technique and Flirting Training.

It contains descriptions of all your negative thoughts, memories, and fears. When you read from this book, you'll feel overwhelmed with feelings of depression, anxiety, hopelessness and shame. Your hypnotist will guide you as you destroy this book. You can burn it, bury it, or shred it. Then you'll find yourself in the library again, where you'll take a book from the shelf on the right.

You can gradually increase the length of time you spend in the elevator. You can use Gradual Exposure for any phobia, such as the fear of heights, needles, or dogs, as well as other forms of anxiety, such as shyness or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. You can also create a Fear Hierarchy, listing the least threatening situation as +1, and the most threatening as +10. You can record the type and amount of exposure you perform each day, as well as how anxious you felt, between 0% and 100%. When you use Flooding, you expose yourself to the thing you fear all at once. For example, if you have an elevator phobia, you can force yourself to get on an elevator and ride up and down, no matter how anxious you feel, until your fear disappears. Flooding is more frightening than Gradual Exposure, but it works more rapidly. Both approaches have been used successfully in the treatment of nearly all forms of anxiety, so you can use the approach that appeals to you the most."

These mental pictures can be likened to a horrifying internal movie that you replay over and over, in exactly the same way every time. You can edit the frightening scenes in this movie in much the same way that you can change your negative thoughts. For example, if your best buddy was killed by a hand grenade when you were fighting together in Vietnam, horrifying memories of his body being blown apart may haunt you. You can bring him back to life in your mind's eye and tell him all the things you never got to say before he died. Then you can give him a proper burial and say goodbye. Changing the images can create a sense of mastery and help you overcome the feelings of helplessness that resulted from being a victim.

These techniques require considerable practice and must come from the heart or they'll backfire. 1. The Disarming Technique. Find some truth in what the other person is saying, even if it seems totally unreasonable or unfair. 2. Empathy. Try to see the world through the other person's eyes. Paraphrase their words (Thought Empathy) and acknowledge how they're probably feeling, based on what she or he said (Feeling Empathy). 3. Inquiry. Ask gentle, probing questions to learn more about what the other person is thinking and feeling. 4. \"I Feel\" Statements. Express your own ideas and feelings in a direct, tactful manner. Use \"I Feel\" Statements, such as \"I'm feeling upset,\" rather than \"You\" statements, such as \"You're making me furious!\" 5. Stroking. Convey an attitude of respect, even if you feel angry with the other person. Find something genuinely positive to say, even in the heat of battle."

    description: "You and your partner take turns playing the roles of Talker and Listener. The Talker spends 30 seconds expressing his or her feelings about a relationship problem. The Listener paraphrases what the Talker said as accurately as possible. The Talker rates the Listener's accuracy from 0% – 100%. Once the Listener receives a rating of 95% or better, you can do a role-reversal. This technique ensures nearly perfect communication. It quickly breaks the pattern of accusation, self-defense, and hostility, and shifts the dialogue to a level of greater vulnerability and intimacy."

Could you welcome any wanting to change it, make it different, push it away or hold onto it? Could you welcome wanting approval, control, security, welcome any wanting separation or oneness? Welcome all the wanting. Could you resist making it real again? Could you welcome making it real again? 4. Could you welcome taking things personally? Could you welcome any blaming? Could you welcome any sense that any of this is who you really are or that this is part of your identity? 5. Now, just open up inside, and notice what happens. Allow yourself to notice the spin. Allow yourself to notice what is beyond the spin. And what is actually here, right now?",

Distant sounds? The physical sensations of the breath flowing in and out of the body. The ribs expanding and contracting. The belly rising and falling. The simple sense of being here, of being alive. And now, a couple of questions: What happened to the problem you were thinking about? Was it still there while you were doing the exercise? Or did you perhaps forget about it while your attention was fixed on the here and now? And the second question. When you are fully present in the moment, i.e. not idly thinking about anything, is there any sense that something is missing? Or is the notion that something is missing no more than a thought — a thought that, when believed, creates misery in your life? Life is happening here and now. When we live in our heads—in the not here, not now— we miss it."
